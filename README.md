# Introduction

globally, through long-term stakeholder value creation based on Leadership with Trust’. With a revenue of $128 billion (INR 9.6 trillion) in 2021-22, the companies collectively

The virtual experience program is offered by Tata iQ, also known as Tata Insights and Quants. Through this program, I explore how dedicated and diverse experts leverage data 
visualization technologies such as Tableau and Power BI to address challenging business problems. They reveal intriguing insights hidden within extensive sets of generated data.
This initiative showcases the real-world challenges routinely faced by Tata Insights and Quants, striving to replicate the difficulties individuals may encounter in their daily 
endeavors.

# There are 4 modules in this virtual experience programme.
♦ Framing the Business Scenario

♦ Choosing the Right Visuals

♦ Creating Effective Visuals

♦ Communicating Insights and Analysis

# Module 1
I need to get ready for a meeting with the CEO and CMO by formulating questions that I believe will be significant and pertinent to each of them. The store has given me a dataset 
to examine and employ as the foundation for my analysis. I am tasked with developing a set of four questions for both the CEO and CMO, recognizing the distinct perspectives they 
bring to business decisions. I am required to submit a total of eight questions in the text submission box below.

# Module 2: Learn which visuals are most effective in a given scenario
The CEO and CMO have tasked me with creating visuals for the metrics they intend to analyze for the online retail store. My responsibility involves gathering their requirements 
and suggesting the most suitable visualizations for each scenario. The senior management aims to comprehend the company's performance, highlighting key strengths and identifying
growth opportunities for future revenue generation.

The CEO will present multiple visualization requests, and my role is to provide visuals that succinctly convey data and insights in the simplest manner possible. It is crucial
that these visuals accurately represent the information, as any misrepresentation could lead to the senior management receiving incorrect messages or making misguided decisions. 
Therefore, ensuring the use of appropriate visuals for each set of data is imperative in this exercise.

# Module 3: Utilize the information provided and generate visuals based on business scenarios. 
Following a recent meeting between the CEO and CMO to finalize requirements, they have requested analysis and visuals to address their inquiries. Both executives are keen on
leveraging data for more informed decision-making, particularly in crafting an expansion strategy. My task involves presenting insights that can contribute to the formulation of 
this strategy.

The executives are interested in examining trends and categorically breaking down data to gain clarity on revenue generation and the key factors influencing the online store. 
Once I receive the executives' requirements regarding data presentation, I will ensure the data's quality by eliminating any discrepancies that could adversely impact the analysis.

Upon cleaning the data, the subsequent step involves creating visuals using either Tableau or Power BI. Regardless of the chosen tool, the objective is to yield consistent results.
These visual outputs are essential for aiding executives in effective decision-making and supporting their expansion strategy.

# Details for task
1: Data cleanup
2: Create a check that the quantity should not be below 1 unit
3: Create a check that the Unit price should not be below $0

# Module 4: Communicating Insights and Analysis
Now is the moment to share your discoveries with the CEO and CMO. They are eager to delve into your reasoning and approach during the data cleanup and visualization stages. 
It is vital to articulate your thought process and ideas with clarity and simplicity. Additionally, you are tasked with presenting a clear analysis of all four questions from the 
previous task. Ensure that you possess a thorough understanding of the data and the conclusions drawn from your analysis.

The leaders are particularly focused on expansion and are keen to grasp the most lucrative opportunities within their business.
